# Restartify
Restartify is a lightweight restart management plugin for Paper servers. It automates scheduled restarts, supports smart TPS and memory-based triggers, performs pre-restart safety tasks (save, backup, cleanup), and provides configurable countdown alerts (chat, title, action bar, boss bar) with optional Discord webhook notifications.
